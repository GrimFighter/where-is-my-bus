            <p className='about_details'>I am Sayantan Mondal, a passionate software developer with a strong academic background in computer science and a deep interest in web development. I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, where I graduated with a CGPA of 9.53/10. I am currently pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at Jadavpur University, continuing to build on my foundation of technical knowledge and practical experience.

            <br />
            <br />
            During my academic journey, I have excelled in various courses such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Operating Systems, Networking, DBMS, and Machine Learning. My strong academic performance includes being the semester topper in my 5th semester, where I achieved a perfect 10 SGPA.

            <br />
            <br />I have applied my knowledge to real-world projects like "RouteRiot," a React-based application designed for seamless bus route and bus number searches. This project highlights my ability to create intuitive user interfaces, manage data with local storage, and implement advanced features such as search suggestions and recent history tracking. 
            <br />
            <br />In addition, I have developed other applications like a Notes App and a dynamic React form, both showcasing my skills in front-end development and user experience design.

            <br />
            <br /> My technical expertise includes proficiency in languages like HTML, CSS, C/C++, SQL, and JavaScript, with a particular focus on React. I am also well-versed in using tools like VS Code and Git/GitHub for version control and collaborative development.

            <br />
            <br />Beyond my technical skills, I have a keen interest in cooking, photography, and creative writing, which allow me to balance my professional and personal life. I am always eager to take on new challenges and continue learning, with a commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions that meet user needs.
