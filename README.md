# RouteRiot

**Live Site:** [RouteRiot](https://routeriot.onrender.com/)

## Overview

RouteRiot is a React-based web application designed to make navigating public transportation easier and more efficient. The app provides users with the ability to search for bus routes by entering source and destination points, view detailed information about specific buses, and search for buses by their numbers. RouteRiot also stores and displays recent searches, making it convenient for users to revisit frequently searched routes or bus numbers.

## Features

- **Route Search:** Users can enter their source and destination to find the best bus routes available. The app displays a list of buses that match the criteria, allowing users to choose the most suitable option.

- **Bus Information:** Upon selecting a bus from the search results, users can view detailed information about that bus, including its route and schedule.

- **Bus Number Search:** This feature allows users to quickly search for a specific bus by entering its number, providing a fast and efficient way to find the desired bus.

- **Recent Search History:** RouteRiot keeps track of the most recent route and bus number searches. This history is stored locally on the user's device, ensuring quick access to frequent searches.

- **Smart Suggestions:** The app offers suggestions based on recent searches, making the input process faster and more intuitive.

## Technologies Used
